      <p>
        Good service overall with solid bookkeeping practices. There were a few
        minor delays in month-end reporting, but the team was responsive when
        we followed up. Would still recommend for most accounting needs.

        Professional team with good technical skills. The Xero setup was
        well-executed, though we had some initial challenges with data migration.
        Once resolved, everything has run smoothly and the monthly reports are helpful.

      <p>
        Reliable bookkeeping services with consistent quality. Communication
        could be a bit more proactive during busy periods, but the work itself
        is accurate and delivered on time. Good value for the price point.

        Solid accounting support for our growing business. The team handles
        our monthly bookkeeping efficiently, though we've had occasional
        questions about expense categorization that took time to resolve.
        Overall satisfied with the service level.
